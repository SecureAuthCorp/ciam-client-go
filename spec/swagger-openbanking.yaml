        description: |-
          The "kid" (key ID) parameter is used to match a specific key.  This
          is used, for instance, to choose among a set of keys within a JWK Set
          during key rollover.  The structure of the "kid" value is
          unspecified.  When "kid" values are used within a JWK Set, different
          keys within the JWK Set SHOULD use distinct "kid" values.  (One
          example in which different keys might use the same "kid" value is if
          they have different "kty" (key type) values but are considered to be
          equivalent alternatives by the application using them.)  The "kid"
          value is a case-sensitive string.

        The API allows the AISP to ask an ASPSP to create a new account-access-consent resource.

        This API effectively allows the AISP to send a copy of the consent to the ASPSP to authorize
        access to account and transaction information.
        An AISP is not able to pre-select a set of accounts for account-access-consent authorisation.
        This is because the behavior of the pre-selected accounts, after authorisation, is not clear from a Legal perspective.
        An ASPSP creates the account-access-consent resource and responds with a unique ConsentId to
        refer to the resource.
        Prior to calling the API, the AISP must have an access token issued by the ASPSP using a client
        credentials grant.

        The API endpoint allows the PISP to ask an ASPSP to create a new domestic-standing-order-consent resource.
        The POST action indicates to the ASPSP that a domestic standing order consent has been staged. At this point, the PSU may not have been identified by the ASPSP, and the request payload may not contain any information of the account that should be debited.
        The endpoint allows the PISP to send a copy of the consent (between PSU and PISP) to the ASPSP for the PSU to authorize.
        The ASPSP creates the domestic-standing-order-consent resource and responds with a unique ConsentId to refer to the resource.

        The default Status is "AwaitingAuthorisation" immediately after the domestic-standing-order-consent has been created.
